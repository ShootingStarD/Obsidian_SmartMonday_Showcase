  
An interpreted programming language is a type of programming language where the source code is not directly translated into machine code or binary code that can be executed by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Instead, it relies on an [[interpreter]], which is a software program that reads and executes the code line by line, translating it into machine code on the fly and performing the desired actions.

Here are some key characteristics and advantages of interpreted programming languages:

1. **Readability and Portability**: Interpreted languages often have more human-readable code because they do not require the low-level details associated with compiling. This can make code easier to write, understand, and maintain. Additionally, interpreted languages are usually more portable because the interpreter itself can be available on multiple platforms.
    
2. **[[Dynamic Typing]]**: Many interpreted languages use dynamic typing, where variable types are determined at runtime. This allows for greater flexibility but may also lead to runtime errors if types are not handled correctly.
    
3. **Interactive Development**: Interpreted languages are well-suited for interactive development and debugging. Developers can write code and immediately see the results without waiting for a separate compilation step.
    
4. **Slower Execution**: Generally, programs written in interpreted languages can be slower in execution compared to compiled languages because of the overhead introduced by the interpreter. However, modern interpreters and just-in-time (JIT) compilers can optimize code execution to mitigate this performance difference.
    
5. **Portability**: Interpreted languages are often more portable because they rely on an interpreter that can be installed on various platforms. This makes it easier to write cross-platform code.
    

Examples of popular interpreted programming languages include:

- **[[Python]]**: As mentioned earlier, Python is a widely used interpreted language known for its simplicity and readability.
    
- **[[JavaScript]]**: JavaScript is an interpreted language primarily used for web development to create dynamic and interactive web applications.
    
- **[[Ruby]]**: Ruby is an interpreted language known for its elegant syntax and is often used for web development (Ruby on Rails).
    
- **[[Perl]]**: Perl is an interpreted language commonly used for text processing, scripting, and web development.
    
- **[[PHP]]**: PHP is an interpreted language designed for web development and server-side scripting.
    

It's important to note that some languages, like Java, use a combination of both interpretation and compilation. Java source code is first compiled into an intermediate bytecode, which is then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it a "compiled-interpreted" language.
